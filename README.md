# Classification using Deep Learning Networks
## Final Year Project

### Abstract  
The project aims to use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks(DCNN) for Semantic Segmentation of Traffic Scenes with potential applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems.
Deep Learning techniques can improve accuracy of Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D images and their Disparity Map.

### Dataset
